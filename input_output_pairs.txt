# Last step before creating vector embeddings is to create input output pairs.

Given a text sample, extract input blocks as subsamples that serve as input to the LLM.
The LLM prediction task during training is to predict the next word that follows the input block.

During training we mask all words that are beyond/past the target word.

context size - length of input. ie context size of 4 means that the model was trained to look at a sequence of 4 words to predict the next word.
